A gate $G$ is \textit{transversal} if, for some quantum error-correcting code
(QECC), applying $G$ to a valid codeword produces another valid codeword. The
authors use the results of \cite{yu2014} to argue that no additive QECC can
transversally implement the Toffoli gate. They do this by assuming the existence
of a QECC that implements Toffoli transversally and using it to construct an
ITS-QHE that supports Toffoli and performs more efficiently than the lower bound
proved by \cite{yu2014} allows.

The authors define a private quantum channel (PQC), a set of probabilistically
applied unitary operators or \textit{superoperator}, after whose application to
a state, the resulting density matrix provides no information about the original
state. They prove that applying random Pauli matrices to a state implements a
PQC, and that $2n$ bits of randomness are enough to implement an $n$-qubit PQC.
Furthermore, they show that their scheme reduces to classical OTP and requires
just $n$ bits of randomness when applied to classical states. Hence their scheme
can be viewed as the natural quantum extension of OTP (QOTP).

Symmetric Quantum Fully Homomorphic Encryption with Perfect Security

note            = {
The author proposes a variety of specific schemes that implement QOTP as defined
in \cite{ambainis2000}. These schemes involve applying Pauli rotations about the
$x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes, determined by a shared secret key. The QFHE scheme the
author proposes is both efficient and information-theoretically secure (ITS).
This scheme is of dubious usefulness, however: no decryption is required to
evaluate a circuit on the ciphertext, so the scheme is technically QFHE by the
author's definition, but the evaluator must have access to the secret key, which
violates other authors' definitions. Of more practical use, the author provides
an ITS-QHE scheme that is homomorphic over Clifford gates and does not require
the evaluator to have access to the secret key.

Limitations on Information Theoretically Secure Quantum Homomorphic Encryption

note            = {
Since quantum computing has provided information-theoretic security (ITS) in
other domains, we might hope that it would be possible to implement quantum
homomorphic encryption with ITS. Alternatively, even if ITS-QHE is impossible,
we might hope that ITS classical fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) would be
possible over quantum channels. On the contrary, Yu et al. prove a ``no-go''
theorem: They show that, in any QHE scheme where Bob obtains no information
about Alice's data while performing his computation, the size of the ciphertext
must increase exponentially after each operation, precluding any efficient
ITS-QFHE scheme. This theorem holds even if the set of gates Bob can compute is
not universal over unitary gates, but merely over classical reversible gates.
